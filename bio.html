  <h2>Flexibility is our business</h2>
  <p>
    How many bands do you know that can start the evening with light jazz
    during cocktails, play a set of blues during dinner and finish the evening
    with three sets of dance hits from the '70s to now?
  </p>
  <p>Pleased to meet you, too.</p>
  <p>
    We are a fun-loving, talented mix of Calgary musicians and we have been
    filling dance floors since 2002. We have kept the beat alive through blown
    breakers and hurricanes &mdash; once even on the same night in Cuba.
    That was exciting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our "they-won't-know-what-hit-'em" setlists have recieved numerous 
    accolades from spice-of-life enthusiasts, both on and off the dance floor
    (mostly on). Take a sneak peek:

  <h2>The whole package</h2>
  <p>
    We are professional, organized and easy to work with. As chaotic as event 
    planning can be, you can take comfort in being able to say, "we've got the
    music covered."
